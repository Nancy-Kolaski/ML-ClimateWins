# Objective:
### ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization, that is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.
# Hypotheses: 
### 1) ClimateWins can help predict climate change around Europe (and potentially, around the world).
### 2) The weather from ClimateWins locations are located at the top of a mountain and considered mostly ‘unpleasant’ conditions, and will therefore continue to be unpleasant in the future.
### 3) The weather climate across Europe will gradually increase over time.
### 4) Supervised Learning algorithms are are an optimal tool in in predictive analysis needed for weather forecasting.
# Data: 
#### Data was collected between 1800s to 2022 by ‘European Climate Assessment and Data Set Project’ found at https://www.ecad.eu/
# Machine Learning Algorithms:
#### - Gradient Descent Optimization
#### - K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN)
#### - Artifical Neural Network (ANN)
#### - Decision Tree
# Conclusion
#### * Supervised Machine Learning models can make accurate weather predictions.
#### * This study has already shown slight increase over time, and has potential to generalize to the rest of the world
#### * KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) model was the best choice for this study so far (88% accuracy).
#### * ANN (Artifical Neural Network) has potential to produce a more complete depiction of the data, presuming adjustments are made when eliciting this model as long as there is a good understanding of the model and how to manipulate it for best outcomes.
#### * Decision Tree was not useful as the data was too deep and  complex for a meaningful insights
